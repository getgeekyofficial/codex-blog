# MISSION BRIEFING

**Objective**: Reconstruct physical baseline. Eliminate "Tech-Neck" debuff.
**Duration**: 30 Days
**Failure Condition**: Missing 2 consecutive sessions.

## THE LOGIC

The modern environment is a cage designed to atrophy your kinetic chain. Sitting is not "rest"—it is a low-level damage-over-time effect on your posterior chain.

Gravity is the only equipment you need. By manipulating leverage, we can simulate loads far exceeding typical gym weights, with the added benefit of complete neuromuscular integration.

## THE PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Structural Integrity (Weeks 1-2)

Focus on **Time Under Tension (TUT)**, not reps. We are rewriting the nervous system's map of the body.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Exercise</th>
      <th>Sets</th>
      <th>Reps/Time</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Dead Hang</strong></td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Max Hold</td>
      <td>Decompress spine. Grip strength.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Scapular Pull-ups</strong></td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>10-12</td>
      <td>Activate the back, not the arms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Plank Hardstyle</strong></td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>30s</td>
      <td>Max tension. Squeeze glutes/core/fists.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> **Audio Cue**: If you are not shaking by second 15 of the Plank, you are not generating enough tension. This is not a rest position.

### Phase 2: Kinetic Output (Weeks 3-4)

Now we introduce dynamic movement.

*   **Push-up Standard**: Chest to floor. Lock out at top.
*   **Squat Deep**: Hip crease below knee.
*   **Inverted Row**: Pull chest to bar.

## DEBRIEF

Report back to the Hub upon completion of 30-day cycle for XP verification.
