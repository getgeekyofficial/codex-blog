# MISSION BRIEFING

**Objective**: Achieve 4 hours of uninterrupted cognitive output.
**Duration**: 14 Days
**Failure Condition**: Checking social media during a "Deep Block".

## THE LOGIC

Attention is the currency of the 21st century, and you are currently in debt. "Multitasking" is a lie; it is simply rapid task-switching that degrades IQ by up to 15 points—equivalent to smoking marijuana or staying up all night.

To ascend, you must rebuild your attention span. This requires isolation.

## THE PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: The Air-Gap (Days 1-7)

Create a physical environment where distraction is impossible.

> [!WARNING]
> **Smartphone Proximity**: Even having your phone *visible* on your desk reduces cognitive capacity. Put it in another room.

    </tr>

### Phase 2: Neural Plasticity (Days 8-14)

Extend the duration. The brain will resist. This is normal. It is the withdrawal symptoms of a dopamine addiction.

> [!TIP]
> **The 20-Minute Wall**: You will feel an urge to quit at the 20-minute mark. Push past this. Flow state consistently triggers around minute 25.

### DEBRIEF

Report back to the Hub. Upon completion, you will notice a significant decrease in anxiety and a massive increase in creative output.
