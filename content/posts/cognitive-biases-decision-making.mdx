# Cognitive Biases: How Your Brain Tricks You

Your brain is not a rational thinking machine. It's a pattern-matching engine optimized for survival in the African savanna 100,000 years ago. In the modern world, these mental shortcuts lead to systematic errors in judgment.

## What Are Cognitive Biases?

Mental shortcuts (heuristics) that lead to predictable errors:

- **Fast but flawed** decision-making
- **Unconscious** and automatic
- **Universal** across all humans
- **Exploitable** by those who understand them

## The Most Dangerous Biases

### 1. Confirmation Bias

You see what you want to see:

```python
# How confirmation bias works
class Brain:
    def process_information(self, new_data, existing_belief):
        if new_data.supports(existing_belief):
            # Accept immediately
            self.beliefs.strengthen(existing_belief)
            self.confidence += 10
        else:
            # Reject or rationalize away
            self.beliefs.ignore(new_data)
            # Or find reasons to dismiss it
            self.rationalize_away(new_data)
        
        # Result: beliefs become stronger regardless of evidence
        return existing_belief  # Unchanged
```

**Real-world impact**:
- Political polarization
- Conspiracy theories
- Investment bubbles
- Relationship problems

### 2. Availability Heuristic

You think common events are what you remember easily:

- **Plane crashes** feel more dangerous than car crashes
- **Shark attacks** feel more common than they are
- **Terrorism** feels like a bigger threat than heart disease
- **Rare diseases** feel common after seeing news coverage

**Why it happens**: Vivid, emotional events are easier to recall.

### 3. Anchoring Effect

The first number you hear becomes your reference point:

**Experiment**:
- Group A: "Is the Mississippi River longer than 500 miles?"
- Group B: "Is the Mississippi River longer than 5,000 miles?"

Group B's estimates are consistently higher, even though both questions are absurd.

**Exploitation**:
- **Retail**: $199 ~~$399~~ (anchor at $399)
- **Negotiation**: First offer sets the range
- **Real estate**: Listing price anchors bids

### 4. Sunk Cost Fallacy

You can't let go of past investments:

```javascript
// The sunk cost trap
class DecisionMaker {
    shouldContinue(project) {
        const invested = project.timeSpent + project.moneySpent
        const futureValue = project.expectedReturn
        
        // Rational decision: only consider future value
        if (futureValue > futureCost) return true
        
        // Actual human decision: can't abandon investment
        if (invested > threshold) {
            return true  // "I've come too far to quit"
        }
    }
}
```

**Examples**:
- Staying in bad relationships
- Continuing failed projects
- Watching bad movies to the end
- Holding losing stocks

### 5. Dunning-Kruger Effect

Incompetent people overestimate their abilities:

**The curve**:
1. **Beginner**: High confidence, low competence
2. **Learning**: Confidence drops as you realize complexity
3. **Competent**: Confidence slowly rises with skill
4. **Expert**: Moderate confidence, high competence

**Why it matters**: The most confident people are often the least qualified.

## Social Biases

### 6. In-Group Bias

Your group is better than other groups:

- **Your country** is the best
- **Your religion** is the truth
- **Your political party** is right
- **Your sports team** deserves to win

This bias drives:
- Tribalism
- Nationalism
- Racism
- Political polarization

### 7. Authority Bias

You trust authority figures too much:

**Milgram Experiment**: 65% of people administered potentially lethal shocks when told to by an authority figure.

**Modern exploitation**:
- **Doctors** (trust medical advice blindly)
- **Experts** (don't question credentials)
- **Leaders** (follow without thinking)
- **Celebrities** (trust product endorsements)

### 8. Halo Effect

One positive trait makes you assume all traits are positive:

- **Attractive people** seem more intelligent
- **Successful people** seem more trustworthy
- **Well-dressed people** seem more competent
- **Confident people** seem more knowledgeable

**Reverse**: Horns effect (one negative trait taints everything)

## Probability Biases

### 9. Gambler's Fallacy

Past events don't affect future probability:

```python
# Coin flips
results = ["Heads", "Heads", "Heads", "Heads", "Heads"]

# Gambler thinks: "Tails is due!"
# Reality: Still 50/50 chance

next_flip = random.choice(["Heads", "Tails"])
# Previous flips don't matter
```

**Exploitation**:
- Casinos
- Lotteries
- Day trading
- Sports betting

### 10. Base Rate Neglect

You ignore statistical reality:

**Example**: 
- Disease affects 1 in 10,000 people
- Test is 99% accurate
- You test positive

Most people think: "99% chance I have it"

**Reality**: 
- 10,000 people tested
- 100 true positives (1% of 10,000)
- 99 false positives (1% of 9,900)
- You're more likely to be a false positive!

## Temporal Biases

### 11. Present Bias

You value immediate rewards over future rewards:

- **$100 today** vs. **$110 tomorrow**: Choose today
- **$100 in a year** vs. **$110 in a year + 1 day**: Choose $110

Logically inconsistent, but universal human behavior.

**Consequences**:
- Procrastination
- Poor savings
- Unhealthy habits
- Short-term thinking

### 12. Hindsight Bias

"I knew it all along":

After an event occurs, you believe you predicted it:

- **Stock market crashes**: "It was obvious"
- **Election results**: "I saw it coming"
- **Relationship endings**: "I always knew"

**Reality**: You didn't predict it. Your brain rewrites memory.

## Overcoming Cognitive Biases

### Awareness

Simply knowing about biases helps:

1. **Recognize** when you might be biased
2. **Question** your immediate reactions
3. **Seek** contradictory evidence
4. **Delay** important decisions

### Systematic Approaches

```python
# Decision-making framework
class RationalDecision:
    def make_decision(self, options):
        # 1. Identify potential biases
        biases = self.check_for_biases()
        
        # 2. Gather contradictory evidence
        evidence = self.seek_disconfirming_data()
        
        # 3. Use base rates and statistics
        probabilities = self.calculate_actual_odds()
        
        # 4. Consider opportunity costs
        alternatives = self.evaluate_alternatives()
        
        # 5. Sleep on it (reduce emotional bias)
        time.sleep(24 * 60 * 60)
        
        # 6. Get outside perspective
        feedback = self.ask_devil_advocate()
        
        return self.choose_rationally(all_factors)
```

### Practical Techniques

**For Confirmation Bias**:
- Actively seek contradictory evidence
- Ask "What would prove me wrong?"
- Engage with opposing viewpoints

**For Anchoring**:
- Ignore first numbers
- Generate your own estimate first
- Use multiple reference points

**For Sunk Costs**:
- Only consider future value
- Ignore past investments
- Ask "Would I start this today?"

**For Social Biases**:
- Expose yourself to out-groups
- Question authority
- Evaluate ideas, not people

## The Meta-Bias

**Bias Blind Spot**: You think you're less biased than others.

Reading this article doesn't make you immune. You're still biased. Everyone is.

The goal isn't to eliminate biases (impossible) but to:

1. **Recognize** them
2. **Compensate** for them
3. **Make better decisions** despite them

## Why This Matters

Cognitive biases affect:

- **Voting decisions** (democracy)
- **Investment choices** (your wealth)
- **Relationship judgments** (your happiness)
- **Health decisions** (your life)
- **Career moves** (your success)

Understanding biases is understanding yourself.

> **Remember**: Your brain is not designed for truth. It's designed for survival. Truth requires effort.

*Question your thoughts. They're probably biased.*
