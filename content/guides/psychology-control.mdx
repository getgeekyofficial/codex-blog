## Who is in Control?

You like to think you are the author of your own thoughts. But in the digital age, your attention is a commodity, bought and sold by the highest bidder.

This Masterclass is a course in **Psychological Self-Defense**. To break free from the matrix of influence, you must first understand how the code works.

### Your Toolkit

*   **Awareness**: Spotting the "glitches" in your own thinking (Biases).
*   **Resistance**: Identifying external manipulation attempts (Dark Patterns).
*   **Philosophy**: Understanding the nature of mind in an AI world.

The war for your mind is real. It's time to put up your shields.
