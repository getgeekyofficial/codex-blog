## The Accelerated Age

If you feel like the world is moving too fast to understand, you're not solely experiencing anxiety—you're experiencing **acceleration**.

We have crossed the threshold where science fiction becomes engineering. This guide is your map to the territory ahead. We don't just cover the "cool gadgets"; we investigate the **existential implications** of these technologies.

### The Three Frontiers

1.  **Biological**: We are taking control of evolution itself.
2.  **Computational**: We are harnessing the fundamental processing power of the universe.
3.  **Energetic**: We are attempting to bottle stars.

Buckle up. The future isn't coming; it's being built right now.
